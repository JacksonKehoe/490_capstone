# 490_capstone

This is our 4th year capstone for an AR text translator app
Steps for app:
-box around text to test recognition
-translate text and remove box
-match style of text to try and make look clean
-create bar on bottom to choose translation language, have auto-detect as well
-add option to take a snapshot
-extending: add voice, tap the text you want translated, doesnt automatically translate everything (mode/settings tab)
